## Foci ##
#Deadlock
BOI_fallen_kingdom:0 "Fallen Kingdom"
BOI_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "Thirty years of continuous political deadlock and economic decay turned Griffonstone into a husk of a nation. The Regency Council is seemingly unable to solve any of the nation's problems and only spends time on pointless squabbling and fights between factions."
BOI_hire_new_troops:0 "Hire New Troops"
BOI_hire_new_troops_desc:0 "The Royal Griffon Defense Force is dangerously undergunned, undergriffoned, and undertrained. Though we can't provide them with proper funding, we were able to scrape some money to hire at least a few desperately needed reinforcements."
BOI_mines_of_goldstone:0 "Goldstone's Mines
BOI_mines_of_goldstone_desc:0 "In ages passed, Griffonstone was famed for its gold and silver mines. However, as centuries passed, these mines ran dry — today only the ones belonging to Lord Goldstone provide a steady flow of precious metals..."
BOI_grovel_for_help:0 "Grovel For Help"
BOI_grovel_for_help_desc:0 "Though we have seceded from the Empire a while ago, there is still a strong faction within the Regency Council arguing for realignment with Griffenheim. Leader of those griffons, Lord Gestal, has some powerful friends in the imperial court and could ask them for help..."
BOI_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare For the Next War"
BOI_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies, and it is only a question of time before they attack. Currently, the Royal Griffon Defense Force is outdated and unprepared to defend our nation. We should organise maneuvers to assess its state and prepare to reform it."
BOI_whip_council:0 "Whip the Council into Operation"
BOI_whip_council_desc:0 "Through screaming, pulling favours, and making false promises Grandpa Gruff will try once again to make the Regency Council actually do something to rebuild our nation. This will not be an easy task..."
BOI_discuss_reforms:0 "Discuss Reforms"
BOI_discuss_reforms_desc:0 "Although the Regency Council is a pointlessly squabbling bunch of powerful griffons, perhaps there is a chance of forcing or convincing them to cooperate for the good of the nation (or if they do not care about that, just to prevent revolution). Achieving such a compromise will not be simple..."
#Air
BOI_create_airforce:0 "Create Airforce"
BOI_create_airforce_desc:0 "As our nation's military is hopelessly outdated, we need to catch up with other powers of Griffonia. Until now we possessed no actual air force — it's the best time to change this."
BOI_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighters"
BOI_import_fighters_desc:0 "Creating our own fighter designs from scratch may be difficult. Instead we can buy foreign planes and reverse-engineer them."
BOI_air_doctrine_studies:0 "Air Doctrine Studies"
BOI_air_doctrine_studies_desc:0 "Air combat is something more than just putting a few birds into planes and ordering them to attack the enemy. If we want to do it efficiently, we need to utilise proper air combat tactics."
BOI_bomber_designs:0 "Bomber Designs"
BOI_bomber_designs_desc:0 "Fighters are useless for attacking ground forces and enemy fortifications, the most we can do is drop rocks from them. We need proper bombers! We need them NOW!"
BOI_found_air_academy:0 "Found the Airforce Academy"
BOI_found_air_academy_desc:0 "To further expand and improve our airforce we shall create a proper pilot academy — this way we will not have to rely on untrained amateurs."
BOI_CAS:0 "Attack Bombers"
BOI_CAS_desc:0 "The idea of providing direct air support for our ground units seems quite interesting — perhaps we should invest some resources into creating aircrafts designated for such tasks?"
BOI_new_strategic_bombers:0 "New Strategic Bombers"
BOI_new_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "Designing bombers dedicated to long range missions and attacking enemy industry and infrastructure may be very useful — it is easier to fight an enemy who can't effectively move and supply their troops."
BOI_streamline_production:0 "Streamline Productions"
BOI_streamline_production_desc:0 "We do not need perfect airplanes — we will be perfectly fine with just decent ones. What we need is huge numbers of them — therefore it is crucial to improve our production methods."
BOI_improve_bomber_tactics:0 "Improve Bombing Tactics"
BOI_improve_bomber_tactics_desc:0 "Bombers are crucial both for direct support of our army and for disruption of enemy industry. We need to focus on improving their tactics to fully utilise their destructive capabilities."
BOI_improve_fighter_designs:0 "Improve Fighter Designs"
BOI_improve_fighter_designs_desc:0 "There is still room for improvement of our fighter planes and any advantage we can get in this department will be tremendously useful."
BOI_faster_than_wind:0 "Faster Than Wind"
BOI_faster_than_wind_desc:0 "Rockets — a truly wonderful technology. With them we will be able to hit enemies hundreds or even thousands of miles away — we must get some of that new wunderwaffe!"
BOI_wetterkommando:0 "Wetterkommando"
BOI_wetterkommando_desc:0 "By constructing a number of magitech facilities on mountaintops we should be able to manipulate weather to some extent, creating more favourable conditions for our pilots. Of course maintaining such facilities will require a large amount of resources..."
BOI_destroyer_of_worlds:0 "Destroyer of Worlds"
BOI_destroyer_of_worlds_desc:0 "The theory of Maginucelar Weapons was formulated a few years ago. Until now we lacked knowledge to develop such armaments. As our enemies are surely trying to do so it would be wise for us to join the race."
#Navy
BOI_birth_navy:0 "Birth Of Our Navy"
BOI_birth_navy_desc:0 "As Griffonstone has never had access to the sea, our navy is nonexistent and so are our naval traditions. Now however, as we finally control coastal regions it is time to think about establishing a proper navy."
BOI_construct_cruisers:0 "Construct Cruisers"
BOI_construct_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers are a backbone of every navy and we should build some of such ships for ourselves."
BOI_fund_fleet:0 "Fund Fleet Construction"
BOI_fund_fleet_desc:0 "We need to catch up with other naval powers — therefore additional funds should be allocated to our dockyards."
BOI_destroyer_design:0 "Destroyer Designs"
BOI_destroyer_design_desc:0 "Destroyers serve a variety of purposes, making them critically important support ships. For our navy to be strong and protected, we need the most technologically advanced destroyers."
BOI_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
BOI_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Some planners predict that carriers will be a crucial element of future naval warfare. However without special aircrafts, carriers are useless — let’s design some!"
BOI_our_naval_doctrine:0 "Our Naval Doctrine"
BOI_our_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "By hiring foreign officers and careful examination of obtained intelligence data we should be able to formulate our own strategy for naval warfare."
BOI_marine_corps:0 "Marine Corps"
BOI_marine_corps_desc:0 "Specialised infantry units will be most useful in eventual naval invasions and may spearhead such assaults."
BOI_expand_trade_fleet:0 "Expand our Trade Fleet"
BOI_expand_trade_fleet_desc:0 "Sea trade is vital for supplying our economy with resources. We need to establish our own merchant navy to not be reliant on foreign private shippings."
BOI_good_old_battleships:0 "Good Old Battleship"
BOI_good_old_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships were a backbone of navies for decades and will most likely remain in such position in the following decades. If we want to rival other naval powers we should create our own battleship fleet."
BOI_rely_on_carriers:0 "Rely on Carriers"
BOI_rely_on_carriers_desc:0 "It is obvious that carriers are the future of naval warfare — they may be expensive but by using them we will control both sea and air."
BOI_new_submarines:0 "New Submarines"
BOI_new_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines may prove useful for both raiding our enemies' convoys and attacking their warships. As our enemies will most likely outnumber us, perhaps the covert approach will be best for us."
BOI_griffonstonian_admiralty:0 "Griffonstonian Admiralty"
BOI_griffonstonian_admiralty_desc:0 "As our navy grows so do its needs. To properly command a large number of ships, plan operations, and further improve our tactics, we need a dedicated command, which shall handle such tasks."
#Army
BOI_royal_defence_force:0 "Royal Griffon Defense Force"
BOI_royal_defence_force_desc:0 "RGDF is an ancient formation whose origins could be traced to the days before equestrian princesses. Now however it is just a sad reminder of its former glory — undergriffoned, underequipped, and horribly outdated. If we want to defend ourselves it needs to change."
BOI_reichsarmee_veterans:0 "Reichsarmee Veterans"
BOI_reichsarmee_veterans_desc:0 "Reichsarmee was once the greatest army of Griffonia. After the fall of the Empire a substantial number of old imperial personnel from the south ended up in Griffonstone. By recruiting them we could improve the state of our officer corps."
BOI_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
BOI_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Even if we had guns, we would need griffons to use them. We should organise propaganda campaigns to encourage more griffons to join RGDF."
BOI_modern_firearms:0 "Purchase Modern Firearms"
BOI_modern_firearms_desc:0 "Weapons we are currently using were quite good... a few generations ago! Now they should be in a museum. As Griffonstone is severely lacking in manufacturing capabilities, the best option may be to buy foreign equipment and try to copy it."
BOI_griffons_army:0 "Griffons’ Army"
BOI_griffons_army_desc:0 "An age of industrial warfare has come - an age of armies that dwarf in size smaller nations. We cannot rely any longer on levies loyal only to nobles of Griffonstone - it is time to establish a proper national army."
BOI_why_fight:0 "Why we Fight"
BOI_why_fight_desc:0 "Soldiers are not just cattle forced to charge into enemy lines. We need to make sure that every soldier knows for what he is exactly fighting and feels rightful pride from being a defender of Griffonstone."
BOI_common_soldier_care:0 "Care For the Common Soldier"
BOI_common_soldier_care_desc:0 "Though we cannot prevent certain losses it is crucial that we provide all possible help for the wounded — it's a reasonable and griffonitarian thing to do."
BOI_noble_levies:0 "Noble Levies"
BOI_noble_levies_desc:0 "For centuries the nobility was protecting Griffonstone, and why should we change it? Surely, those who were raised to rule will be the ones best suited for leading the new army of Griffonstone."
BOI_right_to_rule:0 "Right to Rule"
BOI_right_to_rule_desc:0 "Generation after generation lords and nobles of Griffonstone were defending our great city. They learned how to command respect from an early age and know that if they fail, not only they will be ashamed, but all of their descendants too."
BOI_emulate_reichsarmee:0 "Emulate Reichsarmee"
BOI_emulate_reichsarmee_desc:0 "Many of our officers served in Reichsarmee in the past. Thanks to their experience we can drill our forces into army that will be able to rival the old Imperial Army"
BOI_new_doctrine:0 "New Doctrine for the New Age"
BOI_new_doctrine_desc:0 "Times are changing, and so is warfare. We need to adapt to this new age and learn from mistakes of the past to win in the future."
BOI_support_the_army:0 "Support Battalions"
BOI_support_the_army_desc:0 "Only fools think that the army consists solely of combatants — without proper support they would be easy pickings for their enemies. It is time to provide such support for the Griffonstonian Army."
BOI_eyes_ears:0 "Eyes and Ears"
BOI_eyes_ears_desc:0 "A new technology called “RADAR” is very intriguing — with it we will be able to provide our forces with much better intel about enemy movements — it would be foolish not to use it."
BOI_military_academy:0 "Griffonstonian Military Academy"
BOI_military_academy_desc:0 "We can't rely only on veterans and hope that new officers will learn the art of warfare on the battlefield. Instead we should create a proper military academy to raise new generations of commanders."
BOI_weltbaum:0 "Weltbaum Project"
BOI_weltbaum_desc:0 "The Griffonstonian Tree is as old as the Griffonkind — possibly even older. Considered sacred, it is a popular pilgrimage destination. However the tree itself is a powerful magical object of potential that has not been fully understood until now. With recent advancements in magitech we came to be able to utilise its unique properties. Of course more pious griffons will be displeased with such actions."
BOI_flesh:0 "Flesh"

BOI_go_after_vedina:0 "Grover I's Only Mistake"
BOI_go_after_vedina_desc:0 "While Vedina was nominally an Imperial subject, in truth they were completely independent and cared little for the Empire. This is because of Emperor Grover I's grave error, the only one he ever made: He made a deal with the local King. This contract has expired and we shall ensure every single griffon, including Vedinans, is united under the Imperial banner."

BOI_the_oil_fields_imperial_desc:0 "While independent, the griffons of Greifwald discovered large oil deposits under their soil.

BOI_core_west:0 "Annex the West"
BOI_core_west_desc:0 "Aquileia and its neighbouring regions have all been brought back into the fold. But this time we will not repeat the mistake of past Emperors.

BOI_reclaim_minotauria_desc:0 "When Emperor Grover II wished to secure supply routes to the east, he sent the Imperial Navy and the Imperial Army to crush the bothersome minotaurs in unison. The cowardly King surrendered after a single battle and a puppet state was created, which was ultimately toppled by radical democratic revolutionaries. It seems we will have to teach them respect."
BOI_core_south:0 "Shackle the South"
BOI_core_south_desc:0 "The "Free South" will be a thing of the past. No more shall Wingbardy and their former allies be subject states. Instead, they will be reorganized into an Imperial province. Modern technology makes communication, and thus administration, easy even so far away from the capital. This should prevent the region from breaking off so easily again."
BOI_strike_frontier:0 "Reclaim the Frontier"

BOI_settle_the_kosakenland_desc:0 "Gryphia is a sparsely populated land, the frontier of the eastern frontier, so to say. Its soil however is as fertile as in Prywhen, the ricebasket of the south. By encouraging colonisation and resettling among the Imperial citizenry and granting free land (seized from the cossacks of course) we can integrate the region better than Grover III ever did and tame the wild Kosakenland."
BOI_core_frontier:0 "Integrate the Frontier"

BOI_attack_GRF:0 "Reclaim Our Colony"
BOI_attack_GRF_desc:0 "Everything the Empire used to control on Griffonia -- and more -- has been reclaimed after much bloodshed and conflict. However, our task is not yet over. Our colony on Equus, founded by Emperor Grover I himself in 783, has become an independent nation that shows little interest in acknowledging our authority.
