 GOY_WS_BOI:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] – The Kingdom Without A King"
 GOY_WS_BOI_desc:0 "Griffonstone is the oldest griffonian city on the continent, older than anyone could guess, built thousands of years before alicorn princesses became rulers of Equestria. When gods created griffons, they placed the first of their kind on the Solarspike Mountain. There, griffons found the Great Tree, and on top of it built their first city – Griffonstone. Ever since that day, Griffonstone was one of most powerful and influential settlements in Griffonia, considered its spiritual and religious centre – the Home of Gods. For centuries, the Archon of Boreas resided in Griffonstone. \n\nFor a brief time, Griffonstone was a part of the Arantigan Empire, but, after its collapse, locals banished the Arantigan governor, regaining their sovereignity. After this, the Kingdom of Griffonstone was reestablished under the von Greifenstein dynasty, today known only by the line of Grover. Back then, Griffonstone encompassed lands beyond its current borders, including the lands of Blackhollow and Rumare. At its greatest extent, it even controlled Angriver and the northern part of Falcor. \n\nEverything changed, when, in 704 ALB, Grover became King of Griffonstone. The young king was blessed by Boreas himself and was granted with the Idol – a powerful artifact of great magical power which later became the symbol of divine right to rule and of griffonian unity. In just one year, Grover defeated the kings of Wingbardy and Aquileia, conquering most of Griffonia. As Grover’s conquests progressed, Griffonstone’s importance, however, diminished, fading in comparison to other large cities of the newly forged empire. The first Kaiser moved the capital to a completely new city – Greiffenheim, which also became the new seat of the Archon of Boreas. \n\nAfter Grover I died, his son and heir, Grover II, handed over the crown of Griffonstone to his younger brother – Guto I, founder of a cadet branch of the Imperial Dynasty. Guto was entrusted with guarding the Idol of Boreas which had lost its magical power upon the death of its original holder, though remained a powerful symbol of the dynasty’s divine origins. \n\nThroughout the age of prosperity of the Empire, kings of Griffonstone were among the most loyal subjects of its kaisers. Griffonstone was growing rich from trade and pilgrimages, its schools and archives were famous across Griffonia. However, when Western Griffonia started industrialising, Griffonstone started losing relevancy once again, getting outshadowed by cities of Herzland, Wingbardy, and Aquileia.\n\nThe final fall of Griffonstone was unexpected and devastating. After the death of Emperor Grover IV in 970 ALB, the king of Griffonstone, Guto VI, was expected to become the regent for underage Grover V. However, in 971 ALB the city of Griffonstone was attacked by Cyclops Arimaspi. A creature which, some say, was sent by Maar himself, easily slaughtered the Royal Guard and stole the Idol of Boreas. King Guto VI with his remaining guardsgriffs tried to stop the beast. In the last valant attempt to save the Idol, Guto IV fought the cyclops one-on-one, managing to slay the beast, however, himself perishing in the fight. The Idol itself fell with the cyclops into the depths of the Abyss – a place considered cursed, known for its treacherous winds preventing griffons from descending down its rocky walls.\n\nWhat followed was utter chaos. Nobles of Griffonstone formed the Regency Council and refused to accept prince Guto VII as their new king, claiming that his dynasty lost divine favour. Soon after, the Empire collapsed, as Aquileia and Wingbardy seceded. Griffonstone, highly reliant on trade and the steady flow of pilgrims, suddenly found itself in a crippling economic crisis, which the council was unable to solve. As the economy plummeted, nobles started fighting for power, further weakening the kingdom. When in 978 a revolution overthrew the Emperor, lords of Griffonstone easily quelled the badly organised local republican uprising and declared independence.\n\nWhat followed was three decades of misery; economical, societal, and political degradation. Rumare became de-facto independent right after the death of Guto VI, while Blackhollow’s count Gabriel Bluecrest declared independence from Griffonstone in 985 ALB. In 992 ALB, prince Guto VII managed to convince the Regency Council to let him lead an expedition to Blackhollow, in hopes of both reclaiming the rebellious province and gathering public support for his claim to the throne. However the prince was slain during the battle of Murkbeak, and with him, the line of Guto was extinguished. The battle was also disastrous for the Griffonstonian army, and furthered the nation’s collapse.\n\nNow, Griffonstone is a land of despair – its inhabitants live in poverty, its capital city resembles a giant slum, and its once great archives are abandoned. The kingdom is still ruled by the dreaded Regency Council, led by chancellor “Grandpa” Gruff, an old griffon who does not command the respect of neither lords, nor commoners. But who knows what the plans of this last loyal servant of Gutos may be? Perhaps, he is not as senile and powerless as everygriff thinks... The Council itself is divided between factions, none of which aim to solve real problems that plague Griffonstone. Two most important factions are led by lord Gestal – a stern supporter of the Griffonian Empire who advocates for reunification with Griffenheim, and Lord Goldstone, a griffon of vile reputation, leading a clique of his cronies who wish only for power and money. Citizens of Griffonstone are fed up with their inept government – in 1001, the Griffonstonian Republican Movement was formed by a griffoness named Gilda, allegedly inspired to take matters into her own claws after the visit of two ponies from Equestria… GRM advocates for dissolution of the Regency Council and formation of a proper democratic government – however, due to mass apathy of Griffonstonians, their public support hasn’t grown enough for decisive action yet.\n\nLong gone are the days of Griffonstonian might. The power of its armies pales in comparison to surrounding enemies – the western area of the country is ihabited by the Rumarean minority which wants to reunite with their brethrens from the Rumarean Isles, in the east, Blackhollow is ruled by bandits whose actions are unpredictable, and both Wingbardy’s and the Empire’s governments seek to conquer Griffonstone to improve their international influence and internal legitimacy. Many think that Griffonstone is doomed, and the days of its independence will soon come to an end...\n\n...but there still may be hope for the Home of Griffons."
